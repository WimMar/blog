Lately, I've created some webapps with Vue and I've liked the experience. I don't have a well-tested overview of all frontend frameworks though. Vue is a bit more opinionated than React, which can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending how you look at it. I enjoy having a bit more of an opinioted framework, as to avoid an "embarrassment of riches". (I don't want to e.g. have to choose between four routing libraries)

## Vuepress
A previous blogpost discussed Gatsby, as a static site generator, used for this blog, as well as static sites in general. Recently I've been using a different static site framework called **Vuepress** to write documentation. It can be found at https://docs.rtloc.com.

Vuepress is a fairly recent static doc site generator. It doen't have all the features that some more mature frameworks offer. The main advantage of Vuepress can however be the ease of including Vue components.

We're looking forward to the release of Vuepress v1! (Initial version is referred to as 0.x)
