PlatformIO is a framework which turns your favourite (web) code editor into an embedded programming IDE. Not a VSCode fan? PlatformIO can just as well be used with the **Atom** editor, and there's even integration with other popular desktop and cloud IDE's.
It will add much-wanted features such as debugging, serial port monitoring, etc.
